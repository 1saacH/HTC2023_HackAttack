          <h2>Documentation for <i>Constructor</i> Method in Connection Class</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Method Signature</h3>
          <br />
          <code>def __init__(self, ip, user, password)</code>
          <br />
          <h3>Parameters</h3>
          <br />
          <li>ip: A string representing the IP address of the server to which the connection will be established.</li>
          <li>user: A string representing the username for authentication purposes.</li>
          <li>password: A string representing the password for authentication purposes.</li>
          <br />
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <br />
          <p>The constructor of the Connection class is responsible for initializing a new Connection instance with the necessary credentials and server address. It sets up the basic configuration required for establishing a network connection to the server.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Usage</h3>
          <br />
          <p>Setting IP Address: The ip parameter is stored in the ip attribute of the Connection instance. This IP address is used later to connect to the server.</p>
          <p>Storing User Credentials: The user and password parameters are stored in the respective attributes of the Connection instance. These credentials are used for authentication with the server during data transactions.</p>
          <p>Initialization: The method initializes the conn attribute to None, which will later hold the socket object once a connection is established.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Return Value</h3>
          <br />
          <li>The method does not return a value. Its primary function is to update or add a key-value pair in the table and synchronize the update with the server.</li>
          <br />
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <br />
          <code>connection = Connection("192.168.1.1", "username", "password")</code>
          <br />
          <p>In this example, a Connection object is created with the server IP address "192.168.1.1", a username "username", and a password "password". This object is then ready to establish a connection to the server using these credentials.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Important Notes</h3>
          <br />
          <li>The constructor does not establish a connection by itself. It merely sets up the necessary parameters. The actual connection to the server is established using the connect method.</li>
          <li>Proper validation and handling of the input parameters (like checking the format of the IP address) are not explicitly implemented in the constructor. Depending on the application's requirements, such validation might be necessary for robustness.</li>
          <li>This method is the first step in using the Connection class, making it critical for initializing the object with the correct server details and user credentials</li>
