          <h2>Documentation for <i>delete</i> Method in Table Class</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Method Signature</h3>
          <br />
          <code>def delete(self, key)</code>
          <br />
          <h3>Parameters</h3>
          <br />
          <li>key: A string representing the key for which the associated value needs to be deleted from the table.</li>
          <br />
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <br />
          <p>The delete method in the Table class is designed to remove a key-value pair from the table's data based on the specified key. This method is essential for managing the deletion of data entries within the table and ensuring that these deletions are synchronized with the server.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Usage</h3>
          <br />
          <p>Locating and Removing Data: The method iterates through the data attribute of the Table instance, which is a list of key-value pairs. It searches for an element where the key matches the provided key parameter. If found, the key-value pair is removed from the data list.</p>
          <p>Synchronizing with Server: After the deletion, the method calls server.setTable(self) to update the table on the server with the modified data. This ensures that the deletion is reflected on the server side as well.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Return Value</h3>
          <br />
          <li>The method does not return a value. Its primary role is to remove a specified key-value pair from the table and update the server accordingly.</li>
          <br />
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <br />
          <code>table = Table("employees", [["John Doe", "Manager"], ["Jane Doe", "Developer"]], connection)</code>
          <code>table.delete("John Doe")</code>
          <br />
          <p>In this example, a Table object named "employees" is created with initial data. The delete method is used to remove the key-value pair associated with the key "John Doe" from the table.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Important Notes</h3>
          <br />
          <li>The delete method operates on the local data stored in the data attribute of the Table instance and does not directly interact with the server. The server synchronization is handled by the server.setTable(self) call.</li>
          <li>The method assumes that the Table instance is correctly associated with a valid Connection object (referred to as server). Proper management of this connection is essential for the method to function correctly.</li>
          <li>Error handling for scenarios where the key is not found or the server synchronization fails is not explicitly implemented in this method. Adding appropriate error handling mechanisms can enhance the robustness of the application.</li>
          <li>This method offers a straightforward way to manage deletions within the table, making it a vital component of the Table class for maintaining data integrity and ensuring consistency between the local instance and the server.</li>
