          <h2>Documentation for <i>get</i> Method in Connection Class</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Method Signature</h3>
          <br />
          <code>def get(self, key)</code>
          <br />
          <h3>Parameters</h3>
          <br />
          <li>key: A string representing the key for which the value needs to be fetched from the table.</li>
          <br />
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <br />
          <p>The get method in the Table class is designed to retrieve a specific value associated with a given key from the table's data. This method is crucial for accessing individual data elements stored within the table.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Usage</h3>
          <br />
          <p>Data Lookup: The method iterates through the data attribute of the Table instance, which is assumed to be a list of key-value pairs.</p>
          <p>Key Matching: For each element in the data list, the method checks if the first element of the pair (the key) matches the provided key parameter.</p>
          <p>Value Retrieval: If a match is found, the method returns the second element of the pair, which is the value associated with the key.</p>
          <p>Handling Key Not Found: If no match is found in the entire list, the method prints a message indicating that the data was not found and returns None.</p>
          <p>Receiving Data: The method waits to receive a response from the server. The received data is assumed to be the content of the requested table.</p>
          <p>Table Creation: A new Table object is created using the received data, and this object is appended to the local tables array.</p>
          <p>Closing Connection: The connection to the server is closed, and the new Table object is returned.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Return Value</h3>
          <br />
          <li>Returns the value associated with the provided key. If the key is not found in the table, it returns None.</li>
          <br />
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <br />
          <code>table = Table("employees", [["John Doe", "Manager"], ["Jane Doe", "Developer"]], connection)</code>
          <code>manager = table.get("John Doe")</code>
          <br />
          <p>In this example, a Table object named "employees" is created with some initial data. The get method is then called with the key "John Doe" to retrieve the corresponding value, which in this case would be "Manager".</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Important Notes</h3>
          <br />
          <li>The get method operates solely on the local data stored in the data attribute of the Table object. It does not interact with the server or the network.</li>
          <li>The data structure for storing key-value pairs in the Table class is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a key-value pair. This could be optimized or changed depending on the specific requirements and data size.</li>
          <li>Error handling is minimal in this method. In a more robust implementation, you might consider more sophisticated error handling or a different return strategy when the key is not found.</li>
          <li>This method provides a simple and direct way to access data from a table, making it a fundamental part of the Table class's functionality.</li>
