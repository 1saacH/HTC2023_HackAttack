          <h2>Documentation for <i>set</i> Method in Table Class</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>Method Signature</h3>
          <br />
          <code>def set(self, key, value)</code>
          <br />
          <h3>Parameters</h3>
          <br />
          <li>key: A string representing the key for which the value needs to be set or updated in the table.</li>
          <li>value: The value to be associated with the specified key in the table.</li>
          <br />
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <br />
          <p>The set method in the Table class is responsible for adding a new key-value pair to the table or updating the value of an existing key. This method ensures that the local table data is modified accordingly and then synchronized with the server.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Usage</h3>
          <br />
          <p>Updating Existing Data: The method iterates through the data attribute of the Table instance. If a key matching the key parameter is found, its corresponding value is updated with the new value.</p>
          <p>Adding New Data: If the key is not found in the existing data, a new key-value pair ([key, value]) is appended to the data list.</p>
          <p>Synchronizing with Server: After modifying the local data, the method calls server.setTable(self) to send the updated table to the server. This ensures that the changes are reflected on the server side as well.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Return Value</h3>
          <br />
          <li>The method does not return a value. Its primary function is to update or add a key-value pair in the table and synchronize the update with the server.</li>
          <br />
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <br />
          <code>table = Table("employees", [["John Doe", "Manager"]], connection)</code>
          <code>table.set("Jane Doe", "Developer")</code>
          <br />
          <p>In this example, a Table object named "employees" is created with initial data. The set method is then used to add a new key-value pair ("Jane Doe", "Developer") to the table.</p>
          <br />
          <h3>Important Notes</h3>
          <br />
          <li>The set method directly modifies the data attribute of the Table instance, ensuring that all changes are locally stored before being sent to the server.</li>
          <li>The method assumes the presence of a valid Connection object (referred to as server) for synchronizing data with the server. Proper initialization and handling of this Connection object are crucial for the successful operation of the set method.</li>
          <li>Error handling, particularly for scenarios where server synchronization fails, is not explicitly implemented in this method. It's recommended to add appropriate error handling mechanisms for a more robust application.</li>
          <li>The method simplifies data manipulation within the table, making it an essential part of the Table class's functionality for maintaining data integrity and synchronization with the server.</li>
